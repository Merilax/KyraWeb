                    <h3>Kyra! Industries</h3>
                    <p class="mainSectionText">
                        A newfound Break Arts company looking to pioneer the field of arts. We swear by our
                        artistic values and specialise in hand-crafting modules and complex machinery meant for events,
                        showrooms, and other high-profile displays, without directly participating in races.
                        Additionally, Kyra! produces naval hull blueprints, which are sent over to Monolith for further
                        development and possible use in an ever improving fleet. <br />
                        You may visit our expositions here at Ragachevo, aimed to attract curious visitors and investors
                        alike,
                        in an unique environment isolated from the racing scene. <br /><br />

                        Furthermore, we want to support artists, no matter what level of expertise, and provide them
                        with
                        their
                        own creative environment and our common knowledge of the field. We trust you will learn your own
                        style
                        and techniques unique from the rest. We invest in you, so you enrich our history as a valued
                        Kyra!
                        member. <br /><br />

                        <i>Kyra! Industries, for your eyes only.</i>

                <h1>Greetings Artist.</h1>
                <p class="mainText">
                    Kyra! Industries is an organisation, established in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/gxeisxgkvDy5jkCs5"
                        target="_blank">Ragachevo, Russia</a>, comprised of two divisions:
                    Monolith, a worldwide naval industry working in cargo transportation, and a Break Arts company
                    that
                    shares the organisation's name.
                    This website is dedicated to the former.
                    <br />
                    Access to the island is available mainly through Monolith transportation routes for commercial
                    reasons,
                    or through a nearby airport for visitors.
                </p>
            </div>

                <div>
                    <h3>Monolith Nauticals</h3>
                    <p class="mainSectionText">
                        A naval industry that excels at transporting all kind of precious cargo within and through the
                        polar
                        region, including most of the world for a substantial increase in price.
                        With icebergs and outer sections of the polar casket being little to no issue, we pride
                        ourselves in
                        rapid deliveries, setting sailing routes only we are able to cross. <br /><br />

                        Massive Monolith ships can be commonly found transporting Kyra! Industries BALC mechs to
                        showcasing
                        events, bringing the spectacle closer to the people.
